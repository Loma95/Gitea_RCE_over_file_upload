For a university assignment i created two exploits for gitea 1.4.0

The lfs exploit creates a fake object id in the database pointing to private repository files.
After that we are able to get the file we are pointing to.

The rce exploit uploads a fake session file into the sessions folder to authenticate as the admin.
After that we can execute code by putting our exploit code into a git update hook and triggering it.

Both are based on kacperszurek's gitea exploit :)

Thanks!
